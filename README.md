  ## Usage
  Here are the instructions and examples of how to use this project:
  You can login or signup on the site then you can access the rest of the site. Create teams in Create Team, upload a profile picture for each team if desired. Once     teams are created then go to the draftboard, select which player you would like to draft then click draft player. The player now be in the draftboard table and the     list below the draftboard table. Once players are selected you can go to View Teams to view all players selected by all teams. Clicking on the team allows you to go   to view each individual team. You can view individual players this way as well, or by searching for the player in Player Search. Once you click on a player to view     their details you can click the Play Highlights button to view Youtbue highlights for that player as well.
